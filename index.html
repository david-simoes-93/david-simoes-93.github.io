        <h3>Unrealized Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simmed City</strong> - a 3D remake of SC4. The goal is to allow larger maps and move to 3D from the isometric perspective (imagine those flying missions but with a GTA kind-of feel!). Better systems (inspiration from SC4 mods), more systems (tourism, scalable buildings, etc), finer control (a road segment occupies 4x4, sidewalks can be larger or smaller, etc).</li>
            <li><strong>Cards Across the Multiverse</strong> - an online card-game where players unlock and play with pre-made decks, organized by ranks (from A to F...). Decks belong to different trading card games, like MTG, YGO, HS, and all work under the same ruleset. Values are adjusted for balance (YGO decks divide all life points by 40, for example).</li>

The coordination methodologies are based in deep learning techniques and solutions, focusing on reinforcement learning approaches, where coordination and communication can be jointly learned. Proposed solutions will be applied in several different cooperative and competitive domains, such as robotic soccer, maze-solving tasks, and pursuit games.</li>

The feature implementation model is defined by modules of our framework, and allows for distributed and fault-tolerant systems to be deployed, which simulate the previously mentioned features and abstract the underlying database features from clients.</li>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Portuguese dad, somewhere in my 30s, with a lot of ideas and not enough time for all of them.
      <br><br>
      I tinker a lot with computers, having worked on robotics, AI, and video-games. I have successfully ruined a few
      robots and wasted a lot of time on useless ideas.
      I also exercise my creative side through writing, editing video, and other occasional experiments in the occult.
      <br><br>
      My biggest fear is to end up on one of those online interviews where I can't answer basic questions. Either that,
      or heights. But definitely one of the two.

***Note of the author***

Dune Rise is a futuristic display font that draws inspiration from the title of the science fiction film "Dune," directed by Denis Villeneuve. Jesta Designs from Fontswan.com created this font using the Canadian Aboriginal syllabary as a basis, which is believed to be the same approach used for the film's logo design.  
   
 It's worth noting that Dune Rise is available for free, and can be used for both personal and commercial purposes.
